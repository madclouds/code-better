# code-better

This is a self help repo for me to keep track of my journy as I challenge myself to code better.

Mostly this is for iOS development, but who knows what else will be in here.

After talking with my manager, we've talked about different ways for me to improve my development skillsets on my own.  Here are some of our ideas:

- Convert internal Objective C frameworks into Swift
- Take courses
- Read Books

I've been watching some videos from Sean Allen: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbTw29mcP12YlTt1EpUaVJw

Structs vs Classes
Use structs as much as possible, but classes when you need reference or inheritance 



you should never force unwrap optionals
you should never use a for loop (use higher level functions map, filter and reduce)
leave off self as much as possible
