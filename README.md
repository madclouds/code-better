# code-better

This is a self help repo for me to keep track of my journy as I challenge myself to code better.

Mostly this is for iOS development, but who knows what else will be in here.



I've been watching some videos from Sean Allen: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbTw29mcP12YlTt1EpUaVJw

### Structs vs Classes

Use structs as much as possible, but classes when you need reference or inheritance.

- you should never force unwrap optionals
- you should never use a for loop (use higher level functions map, filter and reduce)
- flatmap removes nils and converts optionals to non optionals!  neat.
- leave off self as much as possible


### Stuff I want to learn
- Hashable protocol 
- Other Protocols

After talking with my manager, we've talked about different ways for me to improve my development skillsets on my own.  Here are some of our ideas:
### Ideas for learning
- Implement new frameworks for fun
- Look at Github projects and read implmentations
- Write a custom framework (Billboard)
- Publish custom framework to CocoaPods & Carthage
- Do more networking (Almofire)
- Do more NSOperations
- Use Firebase stuff more
- Convert internal Objective C frameworks into Swift
- Take courses
- Read Books/Tutorials
- Write Test!
- Watch YouTube Videos
