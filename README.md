# code-better

This is a self help repo for me to keep track of my journy as I challenge myself to code better.

Mostly this is for iOS development, but who knows what else will be in here.

After talking with my manager, we've talked about different ways for me to improve my development skillsets on my own.  Here are some of our ideas:

- Convert internal Objective C frameworks into Swift
- Take courses
- Read Books
